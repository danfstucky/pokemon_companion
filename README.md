> A Vue.js project

### Pokemon
Pokemon Salmon Red is a full-fledged fan made Pokemon game built with Ruby and RPG Maker. This project provides a companion app for the game and makes requests to the [REST Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.html) for retrieving some basic info. The game itself is not available to the public.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run serve

# serve with hot reload using webpack at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Deployment
This application is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) at danfstucky.com. Netlify is a great chose because it doesn't require any additional project configuration out of the box and is very easy to setup continuous integration.
